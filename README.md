### Initial Setup & Installation <a name="initial-setup"></a>

1. Open your terminal and get ready to use the command line üëæ

2. Install the required OS and Python packages


**Install all Python-related dependencies.**
You might see some 'WARNING' messages about script locations if your system has some of the required scrips already installed on your machine. You can ingore these or surpress them by appending --no-warn-script-location to the line below.
```sh
sudo pip3 install --upgrade --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
```

Install GIT on Linux/MAC
```sh
sudo sh requirements.sh
```
Check if you have git isntalled
```sh
git --version
```
If git is installed you'll see this output on the command line
```sh
> git version 2.XX.XX
```

If you haven't installed pip you can find instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)


3. Clone the git repo to your local machine using your terminal's command line

```sh
# Type this in your terminal's command line
git clone https://github.com/estambolieva/regendered-books.git
```

Alternatively you can [download the `.zip` folder of the repo](https://github.com/estambolieva/regendered-books/archive/master.zip) and decompressing it in a location of your choice on your machine


4. Create a virtual environment to work on (in terminal) & install all needed packages

In the root folder of the project "[user]/regender-xyz" create a virtual environment to use when working on the project. We'll install all the needed packages into this folder.

```sh
python3 -m venv nlp # creates the virtual enviornment
```

Every time you work on the project, activate this virtual environment as the first step after opening the terminal.:

```sh
source nlp/bin/activate
```

Before I activate the virtual environment, my terminal window prompt looks something like this: `katia@katias-laptop`, and like this - `(nlp)katia@katias-laptop` - after I activate the environment. The `(nlp)` shows me that the environment has been activated :+1:.

**Only once**, install all required Python packages needed by executing

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # Install required Python dependencies for regender.xyz
```

5. Install NeuralCoref from core & the correct associated version of Spacy with it

- the normal `pip3` installation did not work. Thus we in

```sh
cd .. # exit the root git directory (= github repo directory) before installing neuralcoref
pip3 uninstall neuralcoref
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref.git
cd neuralcoref
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -e .
pip3 uninstall spacy
pip3 install spacyspacy==2.3.2
python3 -m spacy download en
```

test it quickly (if you'd like) in a Python console to ensure that it works as expected:

```py
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
import neuralcoref      ## ignore RuntimeWarning(s)
neuralcoref.add_to_pipe(nlp)
doc = nlp(u'My sister has a dog. She loves him.')
doc._.has_coref         ## True
doc._.coref_clusters    ## [My sister: [My sister, She], a dog: [a dog, him]]
doc._.coref_resolved    ## 'My sister has a dog. My sister loves a dog.'

exit()
```

## Running the Software <a name="run"></a>

The main files which needs to be run in names `regender_main.py` located in the `code` folder. To execute it, run the command below from the root git folder:

```sh
python3 code/regender_main.py
```

**Note**: Make sure you are running this from the root folder of the git project if you want to use the 1-liner above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è as is.


This will execute the `regendering` logic to the selected text. Let's chat about how to select the text to regender.


### Select Text to Regender

This step consists of two sub-steps:
- update the `config.ini` file in which we keep fixed variables we need when regendering any given text
- update the code to point which text is being regendered on the current run
- (optional) update the code to select that to print as intermediate steps


#### a. Update config.ini <a name="config"></a>

Every time we start working with a new piece of text - we need to update the `config.ini` file. It is located in the root folder of the project. Hint - you can install [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) editor to edit it if you are wondering how to open it. 

This is how it works for now -> whenever we start working with a new text, we create the following entry (if non-existent) for it in the `config.ini` file:

![Config.ini for Rabbit Angstrom: Rabbit, Run](https://github.com/estambolieva/regendered-books/raw/master/imgs/rabbit_config_ini.png)

- `[__BOOK_NAME__]` is the marker used by Python to tell the rest of the code where to look for the replacement strings we introduce for each text/book in this file. **Note**: Currently we use the name of the book as the marker - e.g. when we work on Beloved, we set this marker to `[rabbitrun]` (`__BOOK_NAME__` = `rabbitrun`). 
- `TEXT_FILE` - currently: pointing either to an Excel file with the experimental exceprts of books - pushed to the github repo OR alink to Harry Potter's Google doc on Gdrive; `future`: this can be any link - AWS S3, etc. 
- `TEXT_FILE_SHEET` - either `None` (for Harry Potter) OR `Sheet1` which is the name of the only sheet in the Github repo Excel file 
- `SHEET_LINE` - either `None` (for Harry Potter) OR an integer indicating the line in `Sheet1` in the Github repo Excel file, on which the book exceprt's info is stored at
- `PROTAGONIST_REPLACEMENT_NAME` is the name we give to the protagonist who we regender, e.g. from `Sethe` to `Michael` in the context of `Beloved`
- `OTHER_CHARACTER_SAME_NAME_CHANGE` - we define this in case there is another `Michael` mentioned somewhere in the text - we do not want our renamed proganist's name to clash with the name of another character. **Note** - we developed this for `Pride & Prejudice` - a text in which we regendered `Mrs. Bennet` and changed her name to `Mr. Bennet` - which happens to be the name of her husband. `OTHER_CHARACTER_SAME_NAME_CHANGE` in this case is set to `the other Mr. Bennet`.
- `CHARACTER_1` - we list the name of another very prominent character in the text/book, whose name might cause coreference problems. ‚ùó **Important** - work in progress, this logic has not been fully developed yet.


The `config.ini` file is ready to support the rengendering of a new piece of text. 


**Notable Mention**

One-time Gdrive Authentication

`The authentication flow has completed. You may close this window.`


#### b. reflect config.ini changes in the code <a name="code-changes"></a>


We need make 1 change in the code in the file `regender_main.py` in the `code` folder.

We need to copy the string (`text_id`) which we have defined in `config.ini` and replace what is shown highlighted in `regender_main.py`  the image below.

![Change the code](https://github.com/estambolieva/regendered-books/raw/master/imgs/change_coreference_resolution_py.png)

When this is done, we are ready to regender. Run:

```sh
python3 code/regender_main.py
```

The regendered text is written in a file in the `output` folder (no worries, the `requirements.sh` script you ran when doing the installation and setup has already created it in the root git folder) with a name which consists of:
- the `text_id` or the name of the book the way we have written it in the `config.ini` file
- `_regendered.txt`.


#### c. (optional) update the code to select that to print as intermediate steps
